# About me  

Hey my name is Hueless, I've been a Roblox player for about 7-8 years now, and I've been scripting on and off since 2020 (3 years).  

Recently, I've been focused on different parts of life ever since lockdown ended, so my Scripting capabilities would be much better if I was able to be more consistent. 

## Work/Projects  

In all the time I've been scripting, many games/projects of mine have been unfinished just because I lost focus and such; however, recently I've been making improvements to completing tasks all the way through even if they don't turn out the best. Nevertheless, I will showcase some unfinished work, just to show my knowledge of scripting

## Let's start from the beginning  

I will be showing many of the notable things I've made from when I began to where I am currently. This is to put into perspective how much I've learned over the years.  

### 2020  

Now, not much was accomplished during this time, as I had only a couple months of scripting experience
